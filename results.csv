Our modern farming company combines the benefits of the best local farms with advances made possible by technology to grow produce you can feel good about eating. BoweryOS, our proprietary software system, uses vision systems, automation technology, and machine learning to monitor plants and all the variables that drive their growth 24/7. Because we control the entire process from seed to store, Bowery farms use zero pesticides, 95% less water, and are 100+ times more productive on the same footprint of land than traditional agriculture. Bowery produce is currently available at select Whole Foods and Foragers stores in the Tristate area, and featured on the menus of Tom Colicchio’s New York restaurants Craft and Temple Court. Based in New York City, the company has raised over $170 million from leading investors including GV, General Catalyst, GGV Capital, First Round Capital, Temasek and Almanac.

About the Role:
Data Science at Bowery means building production-facing data products which automate the agricultural and operational functions in our network of indoor vertical farms. The Data & AI function at Bowery is central to the vision of the company as well as its day to day operation. You’ll work with our team of data scientists and analysts as well as agricultural scientists and agronomists who bring the domain expertise to our data-driven solutions.
What You'll Do:
You’ll create innovative quantitative solutions and advance the state of indoor farming alongside mechanical engineers, agricultural scientists, and the farm operations team.
You’ll analyze historical data related to crop growth and environmental characteristics to forecast yields for future harvests and uncover insights about ways conditions can be optimized.
You’ll use the key drivers of Bowery's business and agricultural science to design experimental frameworks to ensure data integrity and empower us to more easily analyze and act upon data from new trials.
You’ll optimize work and production schedules to achieve the highest utilization of time and space in the farm.
You’ll help shape the way our data science team does work - researching and making key decisions about what we build, how we build it, and which tools are best for solving our problems.
You’ll work alongside software engineers to implement data processing and visualization systems that make data readily available and simplify how insights are communicated.
What You'll Have:
You have a strong mathematical background in probability, statistics, and optimization algorithms.
You are fluent in a scripting language such as Python or R for analysis and modeling.
You are proficient with query languages (SQL/Postgres) and maybe even dream in SQL
You have a deep understanding of and have applied various machine learning techniques for solving real-world problems, and can provide technical leadership in the team.
You must be able to translate business, operations, and agricultural questions into data science problems, solve those problems, and interpret the output back into clear outcomes.
You are confident in taking ownership of projects from start to finish and enjoy the process of turning nebulous ideas into reality.
We celebrate unique backgrounds, qualities, and cultures that will enrich the workplace.

Description
The NYU Center for Social Media and Politics supports research on (i) how social media impacts politics, with particular emphasis on the flow of information (and misinformation) on social media; (ii) innovative ways to use social media data to study politics; and (iii) developing open-source tools that facilitate the use of social media data for the study of politics. We are looking for a full-time software engineer to help build software and tools for collecting, processing, analyzing, and understanding large social media data sets. You will use modern programming tools to manage multi-terabyte databases, build data collection and analysis pipelines, and produce meaningful data visualizations. We require candidates to have either experience programming in relevant environments OR a degree in CS. Significant skills working with Python and SQL/NoSQL databases are mandatory. Experience working with semi-structured data, Spark/Hadoop/EMR, Lucene/ElasticSearch, REST APIs, machine learning toolkits like scikit-learn, and linux/unix systems are also highly valued. Interest in politics or social science combined with these programming skills is a plus.
You will work across SMaPP’s diverse portfolio of projects including: analyzing the behavior of bots in elections and the spread of disinformation through social media platforms, working with survey data merged with respondents’ social media behavior, analyzing Facebook data made available through the Social Science One program, identifying which users are most influential in online networks, examining the impact of YouTube and other sites on news consumption of individuals, and studying how and what individuals learn from social media during the 2020 U.S. election campaign. CSMaP is committed to the highest standards of data security and user privacy, and we never release data about individual users. Your role will help us maintain that standard across all of our research endeavors.
This is initially a one year position, with the possibility of it being converted into a longer-term role.
You will be given the opportunity to participate fully in the research environment, including authoring papers and open source software, attending conferences and seminars, and working closely with a broad group of researchers associated with the center.
CSMaP consists of three core faculty directors covering fields of Political Science, Computer Science, and Computational Biology, as well as software engineers, data scientists, PhD students in both Political Science and Data Science, affiliated faculty at NYU and other institutions, and undergraduates. The lab maintains a broad research agenda with many projects moving forward simultaneously. Recent publications and/or working papers have centered on the consumption of fake news, the distribution of media consumption by individuals, the links shared by IRA Troll accounts in the 2016 US election, how (competitive) authoritarian regimes respond to online opposition, and the prevalence of hate speech on Twitter.

Qualifications
Required education: An undergraduate degree in computer science.
Required experience: Significant knowledge of and experience with programming in Python.
Preferred education: Master’s in computer science, data science, or an analytical social science.
Preferred experience: 1+ years programming in a relevant environment, either in research or industry; experience working with semi-structured data, Spark/Hadoop/EMR, Lucene/ElasticSearch, REST APIs, machine learning toolkits, and linux/unix systems; experience with natural language processing, machine learning models, and network analysis is a plus.","1,054",4.2,13 days ago ,"New York University: NYU - Domestic: Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS): Politics Department
